## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Draggable Tabs**: Easily drag and drop tabs to rearrange them or create new panel splits.
- **Resizable Panels**: Users can click and drag the space between panels to resize them.
- **Dynamic Splits**: Split any panel horizontally or vertically by dropping a tab onto its edge.
- **Save & Restore**: Serialize the entire layout state to JSON and restore it later.
- **Framework-Agnostic Core**: The core logic is written in pure TypeScript with zero dependencies.
- **Official React Wrapper**: A feature-rich React component (`<Layout />`) and hook (`useLayout`) for easy integration.
