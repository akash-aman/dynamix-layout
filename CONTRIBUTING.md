## ðŸ’» Local Development Setup

This project is a monorepo managed with `pnpm`.

1. **Install pnpm:** If you don't have pnpm, you can install it with `npm install -g pnpm`.
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3. **Build all packages:**
    ```bash
    pnpm run build
    ```
4. **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```
    This will start a development server for all packages in parallel.

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests

To run the test suite, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## changeset

This project uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage releases. If you are making a change that should be included in the release notes, you need to add a changeset.

To add a changeset, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to select the packages that have been changed, the type of change (major, minor, or patch), and a description of the change.
