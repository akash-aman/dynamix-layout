# Security Policy

The team takes the security of our project seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us privately. **Do not create a public GitHub issue.**

We encourage you to report vulnerabilities through **[GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/akash-aman/dynamix-layout/security)** feature. You can do this by going to the "Security" tab of our repository and clicking on "Report a vulnerability".

Alternatively, you can email us at **[sir.akashaman@gmail.com]**.

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us understand and resolve the issue quickly, please include the following in your report:

* A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
* The commit hash of the version that is affected.
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
* Any proof-of-concept code, screenshots, or videos that demonstrate the vulnerability.
* If you have a proposed fix, please include it.

## Our Commitment

When you report a vulnerability to us, you can expect the following:

* We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours**.
* We will provide you with an estimated timeline for addressing the vulnerability.
* We will notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed.
* We will publicly credit you for your discovery, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.
